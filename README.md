# Credit-Risk-Analysis

# Overview of the analysis

Purpose: Apply machine learning to solve a real-world challenge: credit card risk. 

Strategy and dataset: Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans. Therefore, I need to employ different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes by using imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using resampling.Using the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company, I shall oversample the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, and undersample the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm.
